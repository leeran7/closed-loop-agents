# Team dispatch contract

The orchestrator **runs the team**. It does not impersonate the team.

## What "running the team" means

A stage counts as run only when **all** of these are true:

1. The orchestrator dispatched that agent via Task / Agent with
   `subagent_type` **exactly equal** to the agent name
   (`software-engineer`, `verifier`, `reviewer`,
   `security-reviewer`, `qa-acceptance`, `integrator`, …).
2. That agent wrote `loop/handoffs/<agent>-<timestamp>.json`.
3. The orchestrator **read** that handoff before advancing.

Doing the work in the parent conversation does **not** count.
Using `subagent_type: "custom"` or `"generalPurpose"` (or Claude Code / Codex
without `subagent_type`) does **not** count.

## Required team (cannot skip)

```mermaid
graph LR
  SE([software-engineer]) --> V([verifier])
  V --> R([reviewer])
  V --> SR([security-reviewer])
  R --> QA([qa-acceptance])
  SR --> QA
  QA --> INT([integrator])
```

These 6 agents are the full team. The software-engineer owns spec,
architecture, and all code — frontend, backend, data, mobile — directly.

## Missing handoff

If the handoff file is absent when the subagent returns, the stage
**failed**. Never treat that as success and never advance.

## Quality gates

After verifier succeeds, dispatch `reviewer` and `security-reviewer` in
**one message** (two Task calls). Both must pass before `qa-acceptance`.
Critical items in `findings` **or** `feedback` (or
`exitCriteria.no_critical_findings === false`) → `needs_revision` →
software-engineer. `loopBackTo` is clamped to software-engineer — never
forward past qa-acceptance.

## Prompt-loop vs programmatic loop

| Path | How the team is dispatched |
|------|---------------------------|
| `@orchestrator` / `/closed-loop` | Task / Agent with matching `subagent_type` |
| `yarn loop` | One Cursor SDK agent per stage (reviewer + security-reviewer in parallel) |

Both paths share this contract, `loop/state.json` `dispatched` / `requiredTeam`,
and the same handoff directory: `loop/handoffs/`.
